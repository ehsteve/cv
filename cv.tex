Led successful launch campaign which has led to a new limit on the presence of accelerated electrons in quiet active regions.  \item Spearheaded new sounding rocket proposal to apply new Transition Edge Sensors to solar observations for the first time to provide direct spectroscopic imaging with unprecedented energy resolution (2 eV at 3 keV).  \item Developed a solar hard x-ray telescope instrument concept for 3 concept satellite missions for the Heliophysics Decadal Survey. Presented invited talk at Decadal Panel discussion.  \item Leading the development of new pixelated solid-state hard x-ray detectors for solar observations. \item Raised a total of \$5.7M in funding from NASA proposals over 6 years. \item Independently developed high-sensitivity search algorithm to identify microflares in RHESSI solardata archive. Implemented algorithm resulting in largest database of its kind. \item Given over 65 presentations at international conferences and workshops. % 10th rhessi workshop, 12th rhessi workshop, MTSSC\end{itemize*} \section{Teaching, Mentoring, \& Community Service}\begin{itemize*}\item Founding member and Chair of the SunPy organization whose mission is to develop SunPy, a community-developed, free and open-source solar data analysis environment for Python (\url{sunpy.org}). Has over 20k lines of code by over 40 contributors.\item Developed curricula and lectures for presentation in discussion sections of university-level introductory physics courses. Led discussion and physics-lab sections for physics courses with up to approximately 200 students.% Emily Rauscher, Natsuha Kuroda, Alex Cramer, Marcello Rodriguez, Kyle Gregory, Robert Taylor, +1, Lindsay Glesener, Paula, Simon, \item Mentored over 15 students leading to over 10 presentations at international conferences and workshops.\item Established, designed, implemented, and maintained the \href{http://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/~tohban/wiki/index.php/RHESSI_Science_Nuggets}{RHESSI Science Nuggets website}, a successful community website for solar astrophysics research news. Hosts over 230 articles by over 120 authors from across the solar physics community.\item Raised over \$50k to support international student participation in the SunPy project from the \href{https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/}{Google Summer of Code} and the \href{http://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis2014/}{ESA Summer of Code} programs. \item Served on scientific organizing committee for several international workshops.\end{itemize*}\section{Awards, Honors, \& Professional Societies}\begin{itemize*}\item GSFC Special Act - Individual Award, GSFC Special Act - HEROES Team Award\item Member of American Geophysical Union, American Astronomical Society\item \href{https://jsi.astro.umd.edu}{Joint Space Institute Fellow}\item NASA Early Career Scientist and Engineer Working Group\end{itemize*}\nocite{*}\bibliographystyle{humannat}\bibliography{publications}\end{document}
