Dr. Steven Christe is a research astrophysicist in the Heliophysics division at the Goddard Space Flight 
Center in Greenbelt Maryland.  His science interests focus on hard X-ray emission from solar flares and 
the quiet Sun with particular emphasis on the statistics of small transient bursts such as solar
microflares; hard X-ray emission associated with solar radio emission; and the application of hard X-ray
focusing optics to solar observations.  Dr. Christe completed his Ph.D. in 2007, under the supervision of 
Dr. S. Krucker.  After a short postdoctoral appointment at the Space Sciences Lab, he accepted a permanent 
position at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.  He led the first launch of the FOXSI sounding rocket.
Short for the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager, FOXSI observed a microflare in hard X-rays for the first 
time using grazing-incidence optics. He is also the solar PI for HEROES, a joint mission between MSFC and
GSFC, which modified and flew an existing astrophysics balloon payload to observe the Sun in hard X-rays
($>$ 20 keV) for the first time using hard x-ray focusing optics.
